Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 53 Beta and 54 Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) last week. Check out our [site compatibility notes](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/) for each version, though significant changes have not been observed:

* [Firefox 53 Site Compatibility](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/53/)
* [Firefox 54 Site Compatibility](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/54/)

Meanwhile, the [plug-in support removal](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2016/plug-in-support-has-been-dropped-other-than-flash/) in Firefox 52 had a certain impact on legacy content. The [Extended Support Release](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/organizations/) (ESR) allows enterprise users to continue using Java applets or Silverlight applications in the browser, but they have to migrate to an alternative anyway before 52 ESR reaches the end-of-life in Q2 2018.
