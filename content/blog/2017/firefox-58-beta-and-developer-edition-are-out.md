Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 58 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) this Wednesday. Check out our [Firefox 58 compatibility notes](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/58/) to get prepared for the final version coming January 2018. The good news is those changes are all about the removal of non-standard features, so we don't expect any significant issues.

We're rather interested in Firefox 57 aka [Firefox Quantum](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/) released this Tuesday, that brings the [brand-new Stylo CSS engine](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2017/firefox-57-introduces-new-css-engine-changes-some-behaviours/). Some layout regressions could be observed, so please let us know via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FxSiteCompat) or [whatever](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/contribute/) if you encountered any broken site. We'd like to take as much time for the research as possible.
