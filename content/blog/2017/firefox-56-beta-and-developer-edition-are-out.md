Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 56 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) yesterday. Check out our [Firefox 56 compatibility notes](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/56/) to get prepared for the final version coming late September. There are only a few changes because people are working so hard on [Project Quantum](https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/a-quantum-leap-for-the-web-a3b7174b3c12) that delivers significant performance improvements to Firefox 57 shipping in November.

Meanwhile, Firefox 55 shipped this Tuesday is being rolled out gradually. Given [many changes](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/55/) made in the latest release, there might be unexpected regressions we haven't discovered yet. Please do let us know via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FxSiteCompat) or [whatever](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/contribute/) if you encountered any broken site!
