Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 55 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) today. As you may already know, Developer Edition is now [based on the beta build](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/blog/2017/firefox-54-beta-is-out-release-cycle-has-been-shortened/) instead of the separate Aurora (alpha) channel. Check out our [Firefox 55 compatibility notes](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/55/) to get prepared for the final version coming early August.

The most important change in 55 is probably the [click-to-activate requirement for Flash content](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2017/flash-plug-in-content-now-requires-click-to-activate/). If your site is still relying on the outdated plug-in, it's really time to consider moving to latest standard technologies to offer the best possible user experience.

By the way, we are planning a site design refresh (and more) next month so stay tuned!
