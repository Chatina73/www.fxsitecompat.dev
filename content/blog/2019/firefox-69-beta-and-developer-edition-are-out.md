From the [camera and mic access](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/navigator-mediadevices-and-navigator-mozgetusermedia-can-no-longer-be-used-on-insecure-sites/) to [Flash Player support](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/flash-player-can-no-longer-always-be-activated/), we have seen various changes as usual.
