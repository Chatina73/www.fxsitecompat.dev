[Firefox 71 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) are now available for testing, and our site compatibility notes are also ready to be browsed.

The new release comes with various deprecations including [Application Cache](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/application-cache-storage-has-been-removed-in-nightly-and-early-beta/), [TLS 1.0/1.1](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/tls-1-0-and-1-1-are-now-deprecated-disabled-in-nightly/), [`-moz-touch-enabled` media feature](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/moz-touch-enabled-media-feature-has-been-deprecated/) and [legacy MathML features](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/various-legacy-mathml-features-have-been-deprecated/). Some sites are known to have a [rendering issue](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/x-content-type-options-nosniff-now-applies-to-top-level-documents-causing-some-pages-to-be-downloaded/) as the `X-Content-Type-Options` HTTP header is now applied to top-level documents.

Read through all the [Firefox 71 compatibility notes](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/versions/71/) to get prepared for the final release in December. Plus, don't forget to install our [Firefox DevTools extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/site-compatibility-tools/) to not miss upcoming changes!
