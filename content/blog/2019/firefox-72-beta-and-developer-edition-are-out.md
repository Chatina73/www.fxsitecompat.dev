Today Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 72 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) along with Firefox 71. The new pre-release version comes with a couple of changes known to affect real-world websites, including the [user interaction requirement for push notification permissions](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/requesting-notification-permission-and-screen-capture-now-requires-user-interaction/), [content type sniffing](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/x-content-type-options-nosniff-now-applies-to-top-level-documents-causing-some-pages-to-be-downloaded/) and [WebRTC simulcast attributes](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/pt-and-rid-in-webrtc-simulcast-attributes-are-no-longer-supported/).

Have a look at those [Firefox 72 site compatibility notes](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/72/) to get ready for the final version shipping in January. Also, don't forget to install our [Firefox DevTools extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/site-compatibility-tools/) which now has more than 600 users!
