Sorry for the long interrupt! We have finally compiled the [compatibility notes for Firefox 67](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/versions/67/). Mozilla will be releasing the new version on May 21 instead of May 14 due to an [add-on certificate issue](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/), so you still have a whole week to browse through our documents. We don't expect any major issue so far.

Now we are going to focus on Firefox 68, which will be the next [ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/organizations/) and bringing more changes. Please check back soon.
