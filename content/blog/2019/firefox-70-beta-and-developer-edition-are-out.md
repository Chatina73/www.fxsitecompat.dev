Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 70 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/). From the [FTP deprecation](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/all-ftp-resources-are-now-downloaded-instead-of-being-rendered/) to [MathML 4 support](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/various-legacy-mathml-features-have-been-deprecated-or-removed/), we have seen various changes as usual. Check out our [Firefox 70 compatibility notes](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/versions/70/) to get prepared for the final version coming in late October.

Aside from site compatibility changes, the browser's location bar now [shows a broken padlock for insecure sites](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/firefox-location-bar-now-shows-broken-padlock-icon-for-insecure-sites/) while [removing the EV SSL cert indicator](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/ev-ssl-certificate-indicator-has-been-removed-from-location-bar/). Remember, you can always get trusted certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for free (but you're highly encouraged to give them some donation.)

We'll start covering Firefox 71 Nightly today. Install our [Site Compatibility Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/site-compatibility-tools/) extension to your Firefox and be the first to know about important changes!
