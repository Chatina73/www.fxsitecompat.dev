We know it's a bit late but we are getting back on track for the second release in 2019!

[Firefox 66 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) have been available for the past few weeks. While there aren't many changes because of the holiday season, your site might be affected by a couple of things including [media autoplay blocking](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2019/audible-media-s-autoplay-is-now-blocked-by-default/) and [`setTimeout()` deferring](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2019/settimeout-and-setinterval-are-now-deferred-during-page-load/). The [support for `window.event` and `Event.returnValue`](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2018/support-for-window-event-and-event-returnvalue-has-been-added-again/), which was originally planned for Firefox 65, is also on the list.

Check out all our [Firefox 66 compatibility notes](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/versions/66/) to get prepared for the final version coming March 19.
