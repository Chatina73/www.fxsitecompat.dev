If you're developing a website with Firefox, you're probably familiar with the ever-evolving Developer Tools. We also love it and use it every day.

Last year, we [announced a plan](https://twitter.com/FxSiteCompat/status/996052059035176961) to provide a [couple of tools](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/tools/) including a compatibility dataset and Firefox Developer Tools extension that allows you to check if any deprecated feature is used on your site. The work has stalled due to our limited resources, but last weekend we could finally ship shipped the [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/site-compatibility-tools/) as we try to serve developers better.

Starting with some basic features, we'll continue improving the extension to integrate a useful compatibility checker, enhanced reporter and notifications. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fxsitecompat/firefox-extension). Let us know what you think!
