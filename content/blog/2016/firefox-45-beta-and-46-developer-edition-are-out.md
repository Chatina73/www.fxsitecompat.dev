Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 45 Beta and 46 Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/) today. Check out our [site compatibility documents](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/) for each version, and [let us know](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/contribute/) if you find any other changes or regressions.

* [Firefox 46 Site Compatibility](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/46/)

Firefox 45 will be the next [Extended Support Release](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/organizations/) (ESR). If your organization deploys Firefox 38 ESR and you're in charge of maintaining internal business applications as a system administrator, you can read through our documents from Firefox 39 to 45 to understand the changes from the last ESR, then start testing the apps for Firefox 45 ESR using the Beta version. Note that ESRs are usually not supported by cloud services like Google Apps, Office 365 or Dropbox, because those apps are rather optimized for the latest Release version.

As of this week, our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/FxSiteCompat) has more than 500 followers. Thanks everyone for all your support for this community-driven initiative! We are always happy to work with you to make the Web better for everyone, as much as time allows. We'll soon blog about what you should do in 2016 to keep your site fresh. Need a forecast right now?
