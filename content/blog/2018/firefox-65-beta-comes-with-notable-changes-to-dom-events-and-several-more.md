Sorry for the late post! [Firefox 65 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) have been available for the past 3 weeks. Check out our [Firefox 65 compatibility notes](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/versions/65/) to get prepared for the final version coming late January.

The upcoming release contains a batch of changes related to DOM events that you should be aware of. While the known issues found on major sites have been solved by now, there's a very good chance that one of these will affect you.

Other notable changes include `window.open()` limitation, CSS `text-indent` calculation, WebP support, and third-party tracking protection. Go read through our notes and make sure everything on your site is fine. Let us know if you have any questions.

With 2019 just around the corner, we are thinking of our future. While winding down the project was a valid option for us, we have decided not to do so given the [difficult time for Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/12/06/goodbye-edge/). As [Kohei argues](https://twitter.com/FxSiteCompat/status/1072129480137748480), the web needs diversity, and web developers need information. Please consider [making a small donation](https://www.paypal.me/kohei) so we can keep going as an independent community. Thanks!
