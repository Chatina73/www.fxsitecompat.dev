Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 75 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) on Tuesday. Following the TLS 1.0/1.1 support removal in Firefox 74, this new release brings tightened security, which may result in content served with a wrong MIME type being blocked. The details, along with several other changes, can be found in our [site compatibility notes for Firefox 75](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/75/). Have a look and be ready for the final release in early April.
