Mozilla just kicked off 2020 with Firefox 72 followed by [Firefox 73 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/). We have observed only 4 changes because of the holiday season and shortened release cycle, but have a look at the [compatibility notes](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/73/) to get prepared for the final release in February. Check out [these new API restrictions](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2020/geolocation-fullscreen-camera-mic-screen-capture-requests-from-cross-origin-iframe-are-now-disabled-by-default/) if you have any third-party `<iframe>` embedded on your site.

Our plan for the new year? Honestly we don't have much time now but will continue developing [our Firefox DevTools extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/site-compatibility-tools/) and redesign this website for a better developer experience.
