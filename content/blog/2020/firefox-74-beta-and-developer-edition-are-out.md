Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 74 Beta and Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) today, that will remove various non-standard features along with the TLS 1.0/1.1 support when the final version is out in March. In addition, enabling Feature Policy, originally planned for Firefox 73, will affect several APIs used in third-party `<iframe>`s. So make sure to read through our [site compatibility notes for Firefox 74](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/releases/74/) to get prepared today.

As a reminder, Firefox has moved to a [faster 4-week release cycle](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/moving-firefox-to-a-faster-4-week-release-cycle/). You’ll see the regular updates more frequently from now on. We’ll keep up with the latest changes and post compatibility notes as early as possible.
