Mozilla has shipped [Firefox 44 Beta and 45 Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/) today. Check out our [site compatibility documents](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/) for each version, and let us know if you find any other changes or regressions. Firefox 44 has many changes regarding site compatibility prior to Firefox 45 that will become an Extended Support Release, so make sure your site is not broken.
