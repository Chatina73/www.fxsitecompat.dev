Mozilla has released [Firefox 42, 43 Beta and 44 Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/) yesterday and today. Usually Beta is shipped on Thursday and Developer Edition is shipped on Friday, but they have changed their mind somehow. Check out our [site compatibility documents](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/) for each version, and let us know if you find any other changes or regressions. Firefox 44 has many changes regarding site compatibility prior to Firefox 45 that will become an Extended Support Release, so make sure your site is not broken.
