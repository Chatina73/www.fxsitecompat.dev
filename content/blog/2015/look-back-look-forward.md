We have added a series of [site compatibility documents for Firefox 16](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/versions/16/), released 3 years ago today, for the record. Those documents were originally posted to a Japanese Mozilla community site.

Firefox developers tend to avoid making drastic changes to Firefox releases maintained for a year as [Extended Support Releases](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/organizations/), including Firefox 10, 17, 24, 31 and 38. They rather work hard prior to a stable ESR and that's why Firefox 16 had various changes affecting backward compatibility.

Those changes are actually interesting — from a bunch of unprefixing, object removals, property additions, de-support of insecure SSL certificates to a UA string change — like a showcase of site compatibility topics! Based on those archives among other 350+ documents, we will cover how to make a future-proof site in the upcoming blog posts.
