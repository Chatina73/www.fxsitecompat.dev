The [`handler.enumerate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/handler/enumerate) method, used in [`Proxy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) to trap [`for-in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) statements, has been removed from the ECMAScript 2016 (ES7) spec and Firefox 47.
