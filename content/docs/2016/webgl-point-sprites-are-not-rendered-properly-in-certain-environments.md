      title: "Bug 1268096 - WebGL point sprites malfunctions in Firefox 46 on Windows D3D11 ANGLE"
---
Firefox 46 has introduced a regression in WebGL where point sprites, particle effects in particular, are broken on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 due to an older, regressed version of the ANGLE library. This issue will be solved by porting ANGLE's upstream fix.

**Update**: This bug has been fixed with Firefox 47 Beta.
