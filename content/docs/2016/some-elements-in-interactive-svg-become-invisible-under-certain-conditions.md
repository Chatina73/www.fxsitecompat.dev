Firefox 45 has introduced a regression where some elements within a complicated and interactive SVG may become invisible under certain circumstances, requiring unnecessary user interactions to show those elements. This bug is affecting stock charts on *Yahoo! Finance*. Mozilla developers will be working on the solution.

**Update**: This bug has been fixed with Firefox 46 Beta.
