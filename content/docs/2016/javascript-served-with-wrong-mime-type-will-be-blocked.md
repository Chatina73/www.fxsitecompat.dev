On Firefox 51 and later, JavaScript files served with a wrong MIME type such as `image/*`, `audio/*`, `video/*` or `text/csv` will not be loaded for security reasons, raising a `NetworkError`. The HTML `<script>` element, `new Worker()`, `new SharedWorker()` as well as the [`importScripts`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts) method are all affected. Make sure your script is served with an appropriate type such as `text/javascript` or `application/javascript`.
