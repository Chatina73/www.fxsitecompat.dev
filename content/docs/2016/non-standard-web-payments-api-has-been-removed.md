The support for the non-standard [Web Payments API](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebPayment), the [`navigator.mozPay`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/mozPay) method in particular, has been removed with Firefox 51. This API, drafted by Mozilla to enable [in-app payments](https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace/Monetization/In-app_payments_section/mozPay_iap) on Web applications, was initially implemented in Firefox OS and later enabled in Firefox for Android and the [Web App Runtime](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Build/Architecture) of Firefox for desktop, but it has never been widely used. The Mozilla Marketplace is [removing the payment support](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Marketplace#Upcoming_Changes_to_Marketplace), while Firefox 47 has already [removed the Web App Runtime](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2016/web-app-runtime-has-been-removed-from-firefox-for-desktop-and-android/) from desktop and Android.

In the future, Firefox may implement the standard Web Payments API which is being designed in the W3C [Web Payments Working Group](https://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/).
