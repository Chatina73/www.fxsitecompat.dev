      title: "Bug 1232269 - Getter or setter on unboxed expando object is called with the expando as |this|"
---
Firefox 41 has introduced a regression where the [`this` keyword in a getter or setter](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#this_with_a_getter_or_setter) cannot refer the relevant object under certain circumstances, leading to an unexpected `TypeError` while accessing the property. In the bug reporter's case, the issue occurred with an object containing a large array, but it may happen in other conditions according to Mozilla developers. The issue has been fixed with Firefox 45.
