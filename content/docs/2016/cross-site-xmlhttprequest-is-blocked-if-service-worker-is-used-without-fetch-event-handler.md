Firefox 44 has introduced a regression regarding `XMLHttpRequest` and Service Workers where [cross-site HTTP requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) don't work properly when the site has a Service Worker and it's not handling the [`fetch` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent). When this issue occurs, the `Origin` header is missing in `GET` requests, resulting in an unnecessary preflight `OPTIONS` request and subsequent failed `GET` request. The bug has been fixed with Firefox 45. The workaround for Firefox 44 is adding a simple event listener to the worker code like this:

```js
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
  event.respondWith(fetch(event.request));
});
```

**Update**: Clarified the condition that involves the Service Worker API and added the workaround, according to the bug comments.
