      title: "Bug 1269184 - CSS perspective and z-index not layered properly on Firefox 46+, breaking site navigation on ESPN FC and ADS-B Exchange"
---
Firefox 46 has introduced a regression where an HTML element styled with both the [`perspective`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/perspective) and [`z-index`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) CSS properties is not rendered with proper layering, resulting in an invisible site navigation, for example. *ESPN FC* and other sites are affected. Mozilla developers are working on the solution.

**Update**: This bug has been fixed with Firefox 47 Beta.
