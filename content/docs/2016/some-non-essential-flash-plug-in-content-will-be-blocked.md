As part of the ongoing [NPAPI plug-in deprecation](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/plug-in-support-will-be-dropped-by-the-end-of-2016-except-flash/), Firefox has implemented a plug-in blocklist focused on non-essential Flash content, aiming to improve the performance, stability and security of the browser. The [blocklist](https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-plugin-blocklist), mainly containing invisible Flash pixels embedded on Web pages, is going to be expanded over time while taking care of site compatibility issues. See [this Future Releases blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2016/07/20/reducing-adobe-flash-usage-in-firefox/) for details.
