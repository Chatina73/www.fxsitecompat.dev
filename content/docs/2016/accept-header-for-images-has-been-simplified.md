Firefox was previously sending `image/png,image/*;q=0.8,*/*;q=0.5` as the [`Accept` HTTP header's value for images](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation/List_of_default_Accept_values#Values_for_an_image). This value is not so meaningful at this time since PNG images have become widely used, and *W3C*'s site also has a compatibility issue where Firefox gets served PNG instead of SVG, therefore Firefox 47 and later sends `*/*` instead, just like Safari. Once Firefox [supports the WebP image format](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856375), it will probably be changed to `image/webp,*/*`.
