The non-standard [Social Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Social_API/Service_worker_API_reference), a part of the Firefox-specific [Social API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Social_API), has been removed with Firefox 48. Use the standard [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) instead. Note that the Social API itself has been [removed with Firefox 51](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2016/social-api-has-been-removed-except-the-sharing-functionality/) except the sharing functionality.
