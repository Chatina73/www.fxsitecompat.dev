On Firefox, [keyboard events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent) and [mouse events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) fired on an [`<option>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) element are bubbling up through the parent [`<select>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element, while such bubbling doesn't occur on Google Chrome. This behaviour actually [varies by browsers](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1090602#c27) because the detail is not defined in the HTML spec yet.

For a better Web compatibility and technical reasons, those events will not bubble up when the `<select>` element is displayed as a dropdown list and [Firefox is running in the multi-process mode](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/multi-process-is-enabled-by-default-on-the-developer-edition/). The behaviour remains the same if `<select>` is displayed inline where it has the `multiple` attribute or the `size` attribute with a value greater than `1`.
