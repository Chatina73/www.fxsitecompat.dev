The [`WeakMap.prototype.clear`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap/clear) and [`WeakSet.prototype.clear`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet/clear) methods have been removed with Firefox 46 since those are no longer a part of the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) spec. Just use `new WeakMap()` instead to get an empty [`WeakMap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap) object. The same applies to [`WeakSet`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet).
