Firefox 72 has removed the support for the Diffieâ€“Hellman (DH) key exchange algorithm from the [`SubtleCrypto.generateKey`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/generateKey) method, because it's not included in the final [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) spec. Firefox is the only browser supporting the algorithm, and the usage is extremely low according to Mozilla developers, so the compatibility impact should be minimum.
