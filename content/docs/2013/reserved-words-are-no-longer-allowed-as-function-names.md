The [reserved words](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words) cannot be used for function names. Starting with Firefox 26, such a usage will throw a [`SyntaxError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError). For example, `function delete() { ... }` is illegal.
