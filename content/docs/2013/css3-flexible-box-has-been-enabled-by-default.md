---
The new [Flexible Box (flexbox)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes) implemented in [Firefox 18](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Firefox_18_for_developers) is now available without having to edit a hidden preference. Note that it's not compatible with the traditional prefixed implementation such as [`-moz-box-flex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/-moz-box-flex).
