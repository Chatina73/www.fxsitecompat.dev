      title: "Bug 929530 â€“ Remove deprecated peerConnection functionality which has produced web console warnings since 24."
---
Some non-standard functionalities deprecated since Firefox 24 have been removed from the (currently prefixed) [`RTCPeerConnection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection) interface. Those include the `localStreams`, `remoteStreams`, `readyState`, `onicechange` and `ongatheringchange` attributes, as well as calling `createAnswer` or `createOffer` without `failureCallback`.
