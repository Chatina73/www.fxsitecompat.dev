---
Since Firefox 23, the non-standard [`watch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/watch) method, which allows developers to observe changes made to object properties, throws a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) if the object is [`Document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document), [`HTMLSelectElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLSelectElement) or probably some other DOM element interfaces. A workaround is to use a [`Proxy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). Note that `watch` and [`unwatch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/unwatch) may be removed in the future, and you should avoid using those Firefox-specific methods. This regression has been fixed with Firefox 27.
