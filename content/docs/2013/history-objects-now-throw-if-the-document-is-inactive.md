      title: "Bug 940783 â€“ History objects should unconditionally throw if their inner is not current"
---
The spec of the [`History`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/History) interface has been updated, and the properties and methods now throw a `SecurityError` exception when those are called on an inactive [`document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/document). It would be a problem if you are manipulating [`window.history`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.history) in an [`<iframe>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).
