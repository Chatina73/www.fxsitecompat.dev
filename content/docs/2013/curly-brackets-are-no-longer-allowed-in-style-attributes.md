      title: "Bug 915053 â€“ remove quirk allowing {} around style attribute"
---
Previously, in Firefox [Quirks (backward compatibility) mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla_Quirks_Mode_Behavior), the CSS parser allowed curly brackets around the contents of `style` attributes like `<div style="{ color: blue; }">`. This behaviour has been removed from Firefox 27 for interoperability.
