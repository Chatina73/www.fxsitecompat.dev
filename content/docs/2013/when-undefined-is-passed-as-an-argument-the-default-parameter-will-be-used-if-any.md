The [default parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/default_parameters) is an ECMAScript 6 feature implemented Firefox 15. Previously, when [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined) was passed as an argument, the value became `undefined`. The implementation has been changed to be the default value just like no argument was passed.
