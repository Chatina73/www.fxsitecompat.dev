      title: "Bug 788172 â€“ Proxy is not a function (typeof Proxy should be \'function\')"
---
The [`Proxy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) interface has been changed from an object to a function, and now it's callable without the [`new`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) operator. You may have to care about this if you are using the [`typeof`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) operator for a feature detection, as `typeof Proxy` returns `"function"`.
