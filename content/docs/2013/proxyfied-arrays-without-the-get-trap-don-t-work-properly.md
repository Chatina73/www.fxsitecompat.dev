      title: "Bug 895223 â€“ Can\'t JSON stringify a proxy to an array"
---
The [`Proxy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) object allows developers to *proxyfy* an object. All traps in the handler are optional, but starting with Firefox 21, proxyfied arrays without the `get` trap are not working properly. If the `get` trap is not defined, [`Array.length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length) returns `0` and the `set` trap doesn't get called. A workaround is to add the no-op `get` trap even if it's not necessary in your code.

**Update**: This issue has been fixed with Firefox 40.
