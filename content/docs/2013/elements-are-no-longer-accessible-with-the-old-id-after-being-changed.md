Elements with `id` are accessible as `window.id` DOM objects. Previously, such objects remained on [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window) even after the `id` of the element was programmatically changed. This odd behaviour has been fixed with Firefox 26. The [`document.getElementById`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/document.getElementById) method, which is recommended to use in general, is not affected by this change.
