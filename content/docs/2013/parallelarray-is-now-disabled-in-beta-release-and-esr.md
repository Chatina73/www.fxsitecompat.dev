---
The [`ParallelArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ParallelArray) object, which has been experimentally implemented since [Firefox 17](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Firefox_17_for_developers), is now disabled in the Beta, Release and ESR channels. Use the [Aurora](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/aurora/) or [Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/) channel to try out this feature.
