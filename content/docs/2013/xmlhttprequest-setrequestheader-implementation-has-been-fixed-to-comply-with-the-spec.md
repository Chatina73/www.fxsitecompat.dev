      title: "Bug 819051 â€“ XMLHttpRequest.setRequestHeader() overwrites instead of combines values for the same header."
---
Previously, if the same headers were repeatedly set with [`XMLHttpRequest.setRequestHeader`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#setRequestHeader), the last-specified value was used. This behaviour has been changed to comply with the spec, so those values will be properly combined.
