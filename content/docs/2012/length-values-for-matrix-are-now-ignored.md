      title: "Bug 719054 â€“ matrix() and matrix3d() with length units should be parse errors"
---
Previously, Firefox was incorrectly accepting length values, such as a value with a unit like `10px`, in addition to numeric values, for the `matrix` and `matrix3d` [transform functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function). This behaviour has been fixed to comply with the spec so a parse error will be returned for length values.
