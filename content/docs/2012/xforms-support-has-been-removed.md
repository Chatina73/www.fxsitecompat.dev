      title: "Bug 656311 â€“ Remove XML Events, or improve the implementation"
---
The XML Events implementation has been removed. The development of the [Mozilla XForms](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/mozilla-xforms/) extension that has used the API has been [practically discontinued](https://www.philipp-wagner.com/blog/2011/07/the-future-of-mozilla-xforms/). The [XForms](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/XForms) accessibility support has also been [removed](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=811729) from Firefox 19.
