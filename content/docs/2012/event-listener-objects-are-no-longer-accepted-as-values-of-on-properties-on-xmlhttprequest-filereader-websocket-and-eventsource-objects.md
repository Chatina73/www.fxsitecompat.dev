With this change, handlers in the form of an object with a `handleEvent` property, e.g. `xhr.onreadystatechange = { handleEvent: function() { ... } }`, don't work anymore on [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), [`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebSocket), [`FileReader`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FileReader) and [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventSource) objects, just like the already didn't work on the [`element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/element), [`document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/document), and [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window) objects. In Firefox (Gecko), such code will be treated as equivalent to `xhr.onreadystatechange = null`, thus it won't be executed while no error causes. This is a step to comply with standards and improve interoperability; it will be the same behaviour as Internet Explorer and Opera. WebKit browsers like Google Chrome still accept such forms.

Note that `xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { ... }` continues to work, though using [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener) instead is generally recommended.
