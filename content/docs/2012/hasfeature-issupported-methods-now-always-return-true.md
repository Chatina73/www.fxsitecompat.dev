      title: "Bug 801425 â€“ Make hasFeature() and isSupported() always return true"
---
The [`document.implementation.hasFeature`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/document.implementation.hasFeature) and [`Node.isSupported`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Node.isSupported) methods have been changed to always return `true`. The spec has been changed because those APIs were considered useless. However the SVG features are exception; those methods continue to return the support statuses.

**Update**: The SVG exception has been removed with [Firefox 51](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2016/hasfeature-will-always-return-true-even-for-svg/).
