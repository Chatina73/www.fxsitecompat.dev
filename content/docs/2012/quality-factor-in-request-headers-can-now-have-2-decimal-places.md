      title: "Bug 672448 â€“ Clamp quality factor (\'q\') values to 2 decimal places"
---
Previously Firefox has been clamped the quality factors to one decimal place. The quality factors are numerical values following `q=`, specified in HTTP request headers like [`Accept-Language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/HTTP/Content_negotiation#The_Accept-Language.3A_header). With such implementation, multiple items may have the same value, thus it has been changed to reflect 2 decimal places to make those values explicit.
