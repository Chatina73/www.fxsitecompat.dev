---
The MD5 hash algorithm has been disabled with Firefox 16 because it's [not secure](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Weak_Signature_Algorithm). Firefox users will see an error message when they try to browse a site using a SSL certificate signed with the MD5 algorithm. For the sake of convenience, users still be able to [ignore that error](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=758314).
