      title: "Bug 809290 â€“ document.referrer should be based on the script entry point"
---
When the URL of a nested inline frame ([`<iframe>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)) or a grandchild window is programmatically changed from the parent window, the value of the [`document.referrer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/document.referrer) property now points the URL of the parent window where the script is written instead of the child window that refers directly. This is due to a change of the spec and leads to the same behaviour as Internet Explorer and Opera. WebKit to follow.
