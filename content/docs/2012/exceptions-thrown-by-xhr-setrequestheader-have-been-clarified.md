      title: "Bug 600111 â€“ XMLHttpRequest.setRequestHeader() throws NS_ERROR_FAILURE inappropriately"
---
An exception code thrown by the [`XMLHttpRequest.setRequestHeader`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#setRequestHeader) function was previously `NS_ERROR_FAILURE` regardless of the error. Two exception codes defined in the spec, `NS_ERROR_DOM_INVALID_STATE_ERR` and `NS_ERROR_DOM_SYNTAX_ERR`, are now used to make sure those errors can be clearly distinguished.
