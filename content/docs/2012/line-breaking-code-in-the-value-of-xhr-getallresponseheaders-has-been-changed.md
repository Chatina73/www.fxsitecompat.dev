      title: "Bug 730925 â€“ XHR.getAllResponseHeaders should use CRLF, not LF per spec"
---
The [`XMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#getAllResponseHeaders) function returns response headers as strings divided by line breaks. The Firefox implementation has been fixed to use CR+LF (`\r\n`) instead of LF (`\n`) as the line breaking code to follow the spec. You should be careful if you're doing something by reading header information.
