      title: "Bug 607267 â€“ Image maps are display:block, but the HTML spec says they should be inline"

Image maps (the [`<map>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map) elements), previously displayed as [block elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/HTML/Block-level_elements) in Firefox's Standard Compliant mode, are now displayed as [inline elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/HTML/Inline_elements) to follow the [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) spec. So far, those have been displayed as inline elements in the [Quirks (backward compatible) mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla_Quirks_Mode_Behavior) and on the other browsers. If you'd like to display image maps as block elements as before, you have to add `map { display: block; }` to your stylesheet.
