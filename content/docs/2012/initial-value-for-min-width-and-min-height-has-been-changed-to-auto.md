      title: "Bug 763689 â€“ New initial value for \"min-width\" & \"min-height\": auto"
---
The [`min-width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/min-width) and [`min-height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/min-height) properties now take the [`auto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/auto) keyword as their [initial value](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/initial_value). For the [flexible boxes (flexbox)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes), that has been introduced in Firefox 18 but disabled by default, this `auto` keyword indicates the minimum item (`min-content`) in a flexbox. For the other elements, it has no effect as it resolves to `0` as before.
