      title: "Bug 771390 â€“ [css3-mediaqueries] resolution units (dpi, dpcm, dppx) should be dots per CSS inch/centimeter/pixel, not per physical in/cm/px"
---
The [CSS3 Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) spec has been updated, and [resolution units](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/resolution), such as `dpi`, `dpcm` and `dppx`, now correspond to dots per CSS pixel instead of physical units. The Firefox implementation has been updated accordingly.
