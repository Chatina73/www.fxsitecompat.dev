      title: "Bug 773102 â€“ transition-duration and animation-duration should reject negative values at parse time"
---
Previously, negative values specified for the [`transition-duration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/transition-duration) and [`animation-duration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/animation-duration) properties were interpreted as `0s`, the [initial value](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/initial_value). Such values are now considered invalid and the declaration itself will be ignored.
