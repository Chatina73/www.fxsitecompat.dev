      title: "Bug 804944 â€“ add preferences for sets of CSS prefixed properties"
---
While this is not a change affecting site compatibility, it's worth mentioning because this has been developed as part of efforts to keep compatibility. Preferences to disable some major prefixed properties have been added: `layout.css.prefixes.border-image`, `layout.css.prefixes.transforms`, `layout.css.prefixes.transitions` and `layout.css.prefixes.animations`. Web developers can disable those preferences (change the values to `false`) to test whether style rules are applied as intended even after those prefixed implementations are removed. See [the David Baron's blog post](https://dbaron.org/log/20130225-removing-prefixes) for details.
