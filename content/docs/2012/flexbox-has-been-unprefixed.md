      title: "Bug 801098 â€“ Unprefix CSS3 flexbox"
---
The [CSS3 flexible boxes (flexbox)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes) implementation has been prefixed. From now on, use the related properties and keywords without `moz` prefix. Note that the flexbox is still disabled by default in Firefox 19. If you'd like to test the feature, open `about:config` and change the value of `layout.css.flexbox.enabled` to `true`.
