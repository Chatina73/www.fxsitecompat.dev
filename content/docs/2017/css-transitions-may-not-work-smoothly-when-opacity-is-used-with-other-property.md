---
Firefox 52 has introduced a regression where [CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions) are not applied as specified when the `opacity` property is changed at the same time as other certain property such as `transform` or `visibility`. The affected elements may flicker during the transition or disappear shortly.

**Update**: This bug has been fixed with Firefox 52.0.2.
