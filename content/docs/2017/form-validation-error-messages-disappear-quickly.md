---
Firefox 53 has introduced a regression where the browser's native [form data validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation) error messages will disappear in an instant, making it difficult for users to understand what's wrong with their input. This issue has already been fixed with Firefox 54 Beta. A minor update for Firefox 53, if any, may also contain the patch.

**Update**: This issue has been fixed with Firefox 53.0.2.
