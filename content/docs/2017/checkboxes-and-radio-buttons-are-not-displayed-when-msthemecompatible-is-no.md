Firefox 54 has changed the way HTML checkboxes and radio buttons are rendered, so `<input type="radio">` and `<input type="checkbox">` are no longer [replaced elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element) when styled with `-moz-appearance:none`. It will give web developers more flexibility in designing form controls.


This change, however, has produced an unexpected side effect where those types of elements become invisible if `<meta http-equiv="MSThemeCompatible" content="no">` exists in the document `<head>`.

According to an [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533876(v=vs.85).aspx), the `<meta>` tag in question "disables theme support for the document" on Internet Explorer for Windows XP, and Firefox has also maintained the partial compatibility for a long time. Meanwhile, no other browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, support the non-standard, obscure feature.

This rendering regression has been solved with Firefox 55 by dropping the support for `MSThemeCompatible`. Web developers can work around the issue by simply removing the obsolete `<meta>` tag from the site.
