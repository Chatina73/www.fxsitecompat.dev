Firefox 56 for Android has dropped the support for the Adobe Flash Player plug-in, which was [deprecated](https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html) back in 2011 and [removed](https://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2012/06/flash-player-and-android-update.html) from the Google Play Store later in 2012. Firefox users can no longer [play Flash videos](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-do-i-watch-flash-videos-firefox-android) on their phone or tablet, but the impact should be minimum as most mobile sites have already switched to standard HTML videos.

Firefox for desktop will continue supporting Flash Player until 2020. Firefox for iOS never supported Flash in the first place.
