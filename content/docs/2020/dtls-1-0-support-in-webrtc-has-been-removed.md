Firefox 75 has bumped the default minimum version of [Datagram Transport Layer Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/DTLS) (DTLS) in WebRTC to 1.2. According to Mozilla, more than 98% of WebRTC services have already adopted DTLS 1.2. If you are still using DTLS 1.0, itâ€™s time to upgrade.
