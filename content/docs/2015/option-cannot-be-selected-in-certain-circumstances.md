---
The [`<option>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) element cannot be selected and the parent [`<select>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element won't be closed, when [`Event.preventDefault`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) is called in a [`mouseup`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/mouseup) event handler on `<select>` or its ancestors. The [*iButton jQuery plug-in*](https://www.givainc.com/labs/ibutton_jquery_plugin.cfm) is known to be affected. Mozilla developers have identified the cause and are working on a solution.

**Update**: This issue has been fixed with Firefox 40.0.3 shipped on <time datetime="2015-08-27">August 27</time>.
