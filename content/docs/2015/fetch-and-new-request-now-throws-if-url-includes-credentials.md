      title: "Bug 1195820 - fetch() and new Request() should throw TypeError on URL with username/password"
---
The Firefox implementation of the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/GlobalFetch/fetch) method and [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request/Request) constructor was incorrectly accepting URLs containing a username and/or password, like `http://user:password@example.com`. Firefox 43 and later will throw a `TypeError` in such cases to comply with the Fetch API specification.
