      title: "Bug 1152550 - Cross-frame for-in is broken on Firefox 37, 38 beta"
---
Firefox 37 has a regression where the [`for...in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) statement doesn't work over cross-frame objects, throwing a `TypeError`. Some sites using *Google Caja* might be broken. This issue has been fixed with Firefox 38.
