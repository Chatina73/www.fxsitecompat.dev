---
Firefox 38 has a regression where the [`:active`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:active) CSS pseudo-class is not applied to the [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) and [`<textarea>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) elements. This bug has been fixed with Firefox 39.
