      title: "Bug 1109486 â€“ XMLHttpRequest.send(document) should unconditionally encode as UTF-8"
---
The implementation of the [`XMLHttpRequest.send()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#send%28%29) method has been updated so it will always send the passed data as `UTF-8` instead of the document's character encoding, as per the spec.
