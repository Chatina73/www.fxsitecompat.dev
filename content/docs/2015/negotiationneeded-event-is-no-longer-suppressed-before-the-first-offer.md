      title: "Bug 1149838 - We should not suppress negotiationneeded before the first offer/answer exchange"
---
The [`negotiationneeded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/negotiationneeded) event is now properly fired even before the first offer/answer exchange. If you are expecting the event to be called only for re-negotiations, please review your code to avoid any unexpected errors.
