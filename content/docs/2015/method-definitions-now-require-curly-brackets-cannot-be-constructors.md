Previously, curly brackets were not required in [method definitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions). Starting with Firefox 41, those are required as per the ECMAScript 6 specification and will throw a [`SyntaxError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError) if missing. At the same time, method definitions can no longer be constructors except for generator methods.
