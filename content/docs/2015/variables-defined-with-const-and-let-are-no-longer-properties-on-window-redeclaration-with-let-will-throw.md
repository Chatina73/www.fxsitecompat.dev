As part of the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) compliance, the behaviour of the [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) and [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) statements has been changed to match the spec.

Previously, global variables defined with those statements could be accessed as properties on the global object ([`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window) or [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) in the global scope) like global variables defined with [`var`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var). This no longer works, so both `let x = 1; alert(window.x);` and `const y = 1; alert(window.y);` will be `undefined`, while `var z = 1; alert(window.z);` still dumps `1`. The easiest workaround here is to use `var` instead of `const` and `let`.

At the same time, redeclaration of global variables with `let` is now disallowed, therefore the following code snippets will no longer work:

```js
<script>
  let a = 1;
  let a = 2; // raises TypeError
</script>
```

```js
<script>
  let a = 1;
</script>
<script>
  let a = 2; // raises TypeError
</script>
```

```js
<script src="let.js"></script>
<script>
  let a = 2; // raises TypeError if a is defined in let.js
</script>
```

Also, code evaluated with the [`eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) method will no longer propagate global variables defined with `let` or `const` to the outer context, therefore this also doesn't work:

```js
<script>
  eval('let a = 1;');
  alert(a); // raises ReferenceError
</script>
```

Note that the `let` statement [no longer requires an explicit JavaScript version](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/let-statement-no-longer-requires-explicit-javascript-version/).

**Update**: Starting with Firefox 46, redeclaration of variables will [throw a `SyntaxError`](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1198833) instead of `TypeError` as per the spec.
