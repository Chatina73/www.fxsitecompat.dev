---
The [expression closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Expression_closures) syntax, introduced with JavaScript 1.8, is now considered deprecated and will be [removed in the near future](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/expression-closure-support-will-be-removed/). Use the ECMAScript 6 [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) syntax instead.

**Update**: The expression closure support has been [removed with Firefox 60](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2017/expression-closure-support-has-been-removed/).
