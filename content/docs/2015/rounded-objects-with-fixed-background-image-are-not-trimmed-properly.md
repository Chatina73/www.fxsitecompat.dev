Firefox 43 has introduced a regression where a combination of the `background-image` and `border-radius` CSS properties is not drawn as expected if the `background-attachment` is `fixed`, leaving monochromatic, angulated corners around the object. Mozilla developers are working on the solution.

**Update**: This bug has been fixed with Firefox 45.
