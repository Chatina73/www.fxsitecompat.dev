Firefox now throws a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) exception when the [`DataView`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView) constructor is called without the [`new`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) operator, as per the specification.
