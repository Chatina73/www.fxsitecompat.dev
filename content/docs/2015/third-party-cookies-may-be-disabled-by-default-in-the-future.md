There is a lengthy discussion about [third-party cookies](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/disable-third-party-cookies) and privacy. This change was [originally planned for Firefox 22](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2013/third-party-cookies-are-blocked-by-default/) but reverted on the Beta and Release channels due to obvious compatibility issues. Third-party cookies have been disabled by default on the [Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/) and Nightly channels, the relevant bug is still open, and now [Firefox 42 features Private Browsing with Tracking Protection](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2015/private-browsing-now-comes-with-tracking-protection/). Though there is not clear timeline yet, this topic is worth your attention.
