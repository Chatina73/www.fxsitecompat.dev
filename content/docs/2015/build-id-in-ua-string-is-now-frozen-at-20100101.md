The Firefox build identifier, that can be retrieved via the HTTP `User-Agent` request header as well as the [`navigator.userAgent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/NavigatorID/userAgent) and [`navigator.productSub`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/productSub) DOM properties, has been frozen at `20100101` in order to reduce the browser's fingerprintability. While [`navigator.buildID`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/buildID) still returns the accurate build identifier, this property is considered to be [removed in the future](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/navigator-buildid-will-be-removed/).
