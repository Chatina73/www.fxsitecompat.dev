      title: "Bug 1209480 - Canvas no longer able to render emojis (caused by switch to Skia)"
---
The [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) is no longer able to render emoji characters on Firefox 41 and later for the OS X platform, due to the switch to the Skia 2D graphics library. This broke the emoji detection feature of *Modernizr* used by *WordPress* and others. Mozilla developers are working on the solution.

**Update**: This issue has been fixed with Firefox 46.
