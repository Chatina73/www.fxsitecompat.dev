Firefox 41 has introduced a bug in the CSS cascading effect due to the enhanced style caching, where property values are wrongly calculated when the style is programmatically changed in a certain way. Given there is only one report so far, this issue likely occurs in very limited circumstances. Mozilla developers are working on the solution.

**Update**: This bug, likely reproduced only with font properties, has been fixed with Firefox 44.
