The support for [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) statement has been updated to comply with the ECMAScript 6 spec. First, it is now block-scoped like the [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) statement, so `{ const a = 1 }; a;` will throw a [`ReferenceError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ReferenceError) instead of just returning `1`. Second, it will require an initializer, so `const a;` now throws a [`SyntaxError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError). Third, it cannot be redeclared anymore, so `const a = 1; a = 2;` also throws a `SyntaxError`.
