Due to the new implementation of the [`console`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/console) object, it will be overridden by a user-defined global variable named `console` if exists, leading to unexpected behaviour. At least 2 sites are known to be broken where `var console` is defined at the top level code and [`console.log`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/console.log) is subsequently called. Firefox 31 and above are not affected by this issue thanks to another implementation change.
