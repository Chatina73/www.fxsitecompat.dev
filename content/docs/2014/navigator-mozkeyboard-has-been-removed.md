`Navigator.mozKeyboard`, and its interface Keyboard, for [Firefox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox_OS), implemented since [Firefox 16](https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox/Releases/16), has been removed. The `removeFocus`, `setSelectedOption`, `setSelectedOptions` and `setValue` methods have been moved to [`navigator.mozInputMethod`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/navigator/mozInputMethod).
