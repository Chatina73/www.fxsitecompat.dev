The HTML5 [`<track>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track) element and the [`HTMLTrackElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLTrackElement) interface, that can be used to add [WebVTT](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/HTML/WebVTT) format subtitles to videos, are now enabled by default. If you have a polyfill for this feature, make sure it's compatible with this native support.
