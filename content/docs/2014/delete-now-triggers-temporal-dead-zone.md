      title: "Bug 1074571 â€“ The delete operator should trigger TDZ"
---
The concept of the "[temporal dead zone](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#Temporal_dead_zone_and_errors_with_let)", defined in ECMAScript 6 for the [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/const) and [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) statements, has been applied to the [`delete`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete) operator as well. As described in the document, if this operator is used in a function, a variable with the same name cannot be redeclared afterward, but rather it raises a [`ReferenceError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ReferenceError).
