The [Plugin Finder Service](https://wiki.mozilla.org/PFS2), which allowed Firefox users to easily find a missing plugin with a "doorhanger" notification, has been discontinued as part of Mozilla's plugin support removal plan. Sites using a plugin content should provide visitors a link to the plugin vendor and eventually replace the content with a Web standards-based implementation.
