---
URLs specified in [Open Web App manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Build/Manifest) fields are now resolved against the manifest file's URL instead of the app origin. This change enables multiple apps to be installed from the [same origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).
