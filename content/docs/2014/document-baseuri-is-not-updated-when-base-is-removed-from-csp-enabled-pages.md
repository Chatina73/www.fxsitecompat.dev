      title: "Bug 1121857 â€“ document.baseURI does not get updated to document.location after base tag is removed from DOM for site with a CSP"
---
The [`<base>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) element can be used to change the [`Node.baseURI`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Node.baseURI) property's value. When the element is removed, `baseURI` should be automatically reverted to the default value, which is [`document.location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/document.location), but the restoration doesn't work on Firefox 35 if [CSP (Content Security Policy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/CSP) is enabled for the document. This issue has been fixed with Firefox 35.0.1.
