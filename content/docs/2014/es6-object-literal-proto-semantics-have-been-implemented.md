      title: "Bug 1061853 â€“ Implement ES6 object-literal __proto__ restrictions/semantics"
---
ECMAScript 6 semantics and restrictions for [prototype mutations in object literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Prototype_mutation) have been implemented. Now only a single prototype mutation is allowed in an object literal with a [`__proto__`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto); multiple mutation raises a [`SyntaxError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError). Also, method members like `__proto__() {}` will not override the prototype anymore.
