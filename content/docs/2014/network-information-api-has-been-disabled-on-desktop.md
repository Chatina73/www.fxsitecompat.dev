---
The [Network Information API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API), implemented as `navigator.mozConnection`, has been disabled on the desktop versions of Firefox since it has been accidentally exposed. Currently the API only works on Firefox for Android and Firefox OS.
