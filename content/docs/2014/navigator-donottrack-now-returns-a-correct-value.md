      title: "Bug 887703 â€“ Do not track settings results in wrong value for navigator.doNotTrack"
---
Previously, the [`navigator.doNotTrack`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/navigator.doNotTrack) property was incorrectly returning `"yes"` even when the [Do Not Track](https://www.mozilla.org/dnt/) option was being disabled by the user. Starting with Firefox 32, it returns `"0"` (disabled), `"1"` (enabled) or `"unspecified"` to follow the spec.
