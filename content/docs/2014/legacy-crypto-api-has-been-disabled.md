The Netscape-derived [legacy Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript_crypto) implemented on [`window.crypto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.crypto) has been disabled, including `enableSmartCardEvents` and `version` properties as well as `generateCRMFRequest`, `importUserCertificates`, `logout` and `signText` methods. These features have never been standardized and therefore will be removed with Firefox 34, while the standard [Web Crypto API has been actively implemented](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=865789). See the [MozillaWiki article](https://wiki.mozilla.org/SecurityEngineering/Removing_Proprietary_window.crypto_Functions) for details.

**Update**: Feedbacks on Firefox 33 have revealed that various banks and government agencies are still using this legacy Crypto API, the `crypto.signText` method in particular. Therefore, Mozilla has decided to bring the API back with Firefox 34 and remove it again in the near future once a substitute Firefox extension is developed. Firefox 33 users can still re-enable the API by setting the `dom.unsafe_legacy_crypto.enabled` pref to `true`, and Firefox 31 ESR users are not affected by this change.

**Update**: The legacy Crypto API has been [removed with Firefox 35](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2014/legacy-crypto-api-has-been-removed/).
