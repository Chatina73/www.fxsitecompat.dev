On Firefox 35, [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/CSP) directives are not applied properly if the source URLs contain capital letters, like `https://www.example.com/OnlineBanking`. Mozilla developers have found that Firefox's current CSP implementation is internally decapitalizing source URLs and therefore they don't match the actual URLs. This issue has been fixed with Firefox 35.0.1.
