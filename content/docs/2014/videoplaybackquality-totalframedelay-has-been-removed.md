      title: "Bug 962353 â€“ Remove totalFrameDelay from VideoPlaybackQuality"
---
The [`VideoPlaybackQuality.totalFrameDelay`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/VideoPlaybackQuality.totalFrameDelay) property has been removed since it has been marked "at risk" in the spec due to the lack of implementations.
