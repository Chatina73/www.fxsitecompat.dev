Starting with Firefox 29, [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) with more than 999998 groups will not work, rather raise an `InternalError` say "an error occurred while executing regular expression". This change aims to improve both performance and security by preventing the counters from being overflowed. See [Egor Homakov's blog post](https://homakov.blogspot.ca/2013/12/regexp-groups-overflow-in-ff.html) for details.

Regressions from this change have been reported that some specific regular expressions wrongly cause an `InternalError` where the regex previously claimed "no match" even if they should be matched. It has been discovered that the `trim` function in older versions of jQuery is also affected. This issue has been fixed with Firefox 30.
