      title: "Bug 845690 â€“ Support meta viewport in Firefox OS apps"
---
[Firefox OS 1.3](https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox_OS/Releases/1.3), based on Firefox 28, added the support for a [viewport `<meta>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag) in applications. The default viewport `"width=device-width, height=device-height, user-scalable=no"` will be applied to apps that don't specify one. This implementation is only for backward compatibility and will eventually be removed. [Open Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Quickstart/Build/Intro_to_open_web_apps) developers are encouraged to always declare a viewport `<meta>` tag to avoid a possible breakage in the future.
