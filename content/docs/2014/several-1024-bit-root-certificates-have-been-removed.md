As part of the ongoing security improvements, several SSL and code signing trust bits for 1024-bit root certificates have been removed from [Network Security Services (NSS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS) used in Firefox and other products. Those include *AC Raíz Certicámara*, *Entrust.net*, *GTE CyberTrust*, *NetLock*, *TDC Internet*, *ValiCert* and *VeriSign*. [1024-bit root certificates will all be removed](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:MD5and1024) over the next few Firefox releases, because these are no longer considered as secure.
