---
The [`crossOrigin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_settings_attributes) property of HTML media elements now returns `"anonymous"` when the `crossorigin` attribute of the element is empty. This change has been made in order to distinguish such a case from missing attribute that also returns an empty string.
