      title: "Bug 1036765 â€“ Disable cipher suites that are not in the \"Browser Cipher Suite\" proposal that are still enabled"
---
Some obsolete, insecure or little-used cipher suites have been deprecated and disabled by default to match the [cipher suite proposal](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mozilla.dev.tech.crypto/duNhREcIAe8). Those include 3DES, Camellia, DSS and RC4.
