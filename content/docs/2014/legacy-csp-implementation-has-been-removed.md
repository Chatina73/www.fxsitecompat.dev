      title: "Bug 949533 â€“ Remove non-standard CSP parser and X-Content-Security-Policy header support"
---
The legacy, non-standard [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/CSP) parser first shipped with Firefox 4 has been removed in favour of the standard CSP 1.0 spec implemented with Firefox 23. The prefixed `X-Content-Security-Policy` header is no longer supported.
