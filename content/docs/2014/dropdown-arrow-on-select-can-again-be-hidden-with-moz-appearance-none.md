      title: "Bug 649849 â€“ Make -moz-appearance:none on a combobox remove the dropdown button"
---
Since a wrong `padding` implementation on the [`<select>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element was [fixed with Firefox 30](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2014/incorrect-padding-implementation-on-select-has-been-fixed/), a hack to hide the combobox's dropdown arrow, using [`-moz-appearance`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/-moz-appearance)`:none` in combination with the [`text-indent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/text-indent) and [`text-overflow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/text-overflow) properties, has stopped working. This non-standard behaviour has been restored with Firefox 35 as many developers wanted to have control over the combobox style. Now `-moz-appearance:none` can simply be used to hide the dropdown arrow as before, just like `-webkit-appearance:none`.
