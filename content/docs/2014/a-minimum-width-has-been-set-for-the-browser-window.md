      title: "Bug 897160 â€“ Set a minimum width for the Firefox window"
---
To avoid a potential UI clipping issue with the new [Australis theme](https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2014/04/the-new-face-of-firefox/) introduced with Firefox 29, a minimum width has been set for the Firefox desktop browser window. This size is `425px` on OS X and `390px` on other platforms. If you were resizing the window to test your mobile site, the convenient [Responsive Design View](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_View) can be used instead. The minimum width is not applied to pop-up windows, so this shouldn't affect content display.
