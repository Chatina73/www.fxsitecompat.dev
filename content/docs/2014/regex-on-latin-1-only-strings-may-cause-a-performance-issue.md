In Firefox 33, regular expression operations on strings represented only as Latin-1 characters could be very slow, sometimes leading to a hang. This regression, due to an [internal character encoding change](https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2014/07/21/slimmer-and-faster-javascript-strings-in-firefox/), will be fixed with Firefox 34.
