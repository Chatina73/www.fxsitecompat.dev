Previously, `javascript` URLs specified as [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)`src` or CSS background images were parsed and executed as normal JavaScript codes. This trick no longer works, because it could be exploited to hang the browser, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.
