## Compatibility Data Set

Based on [our 700+ articles](https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/), we will provide a fresh, accurate site compatibility data set that covers the status of the obsolete features on each Firefox channel including Nightly, Beta/DevEdition and ESR. The data will be available by Q3 2018 in the portable JSON format.

## Compatibility Checker

With the fundamental data in hand, we will offer a [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools) extension as well that shows a list of any removed or deprecated features used on the current page, so web developers can fix them right away. Due to technical limitations, it's not possible to check all the features covered in our upcoming data set, but most issues in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM should be able to be flagged.

The checker may also include other useful features like regression alerts and reporter.
